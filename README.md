# Front-end Nanodegree Project #7

### React - Neighborhood Map

## Description
This is a simple React app that uses Mapbox and Foursquare to feature some of my favorite pizza places in Baltimore.

Additional data provided by Foursquare API.

Map provided by Mapbox-GL.

## How to Launch the App
Download or clone this repo to your machine
- Install dependencies with `npm install` OR your favorite package manager's equivalent
- Run `npm start` in the root directory to start the server and launch the app

## Dependencies
- create-react-app
- mapbox-gl
- prop-types
- react
- react-dom
- react-scripts
- escape-string-regexp

- Foursquare API


## How to Use the App
With the app open, you can now explore the map. Each location has a marker, and when clicked, will animate and show the data for each pizza place. If you want to filter the data, use the search input and search by name. If you clear the search, the map will default back to the original markers and listed places.
